# ✈️ Airline Passenger Churn Modeling Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
In today’s highly competitive airline industry, **customer retention is a critical business and analytical challenge**. With increasing competition and minimal switching costs, airlines must rely on **data-driven approaches** to understand passenger behavior and proactively reduce churn.

**Passenger churn** refers to customers discontinuing their engagement with an airline or switching to competitors. High churn rates negatively impact **revenue, customer lifetime value, and brand loyalty**, while significantly increasing acquisition costs.

Industry research indicates that **acquiring a new customer costs 5–7 times more than retaining an existing one**, highlighting the importance of early churn detection. This project leverages **machine learning techniques** to identify at-risk passengers and enable proactive retention strategies.

## 🎯 Project Objective  
The primary objective of this project is to develop a **supervised machine learning classification model** that predicts whether a passenger is likely to churn based on historical loyalty and flight activity data.

### Key objectives:
- 🔮 Predict passenger churn with high accuracy  
- 🔍 Identify the most influential factors driving churn  
- 📊 Enable targeted, data-driven retention strategies  

The insights generated can help airlines optimize loyalty programs, improve service quality, and design personalized engagement initiatives.

## 📊 Why Machine Learning for Churn Prediction?  
**Supervised classification algorithms** are well-suited for churn prediction as they learn patterns from labeled historical data to differentiate between churned and retained passengers.

Beyond prediction, machine learning models provide **interpretability through feature importance analysis**, enabling identification of key churn drivers such as:
- Loyalty program engagement  
- Travel frequency and flight activity  
- Customer tenure and service experience  

These insights directly support **business decision-making and strategic planning**.
